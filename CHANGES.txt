SciMath CHANGELOG
=================

Change summary since 4.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added __str__ methods on UnitScalar and UnitArray classes, to make it easier 
  to see values with their unit (label) (#46).

* UnitArray comparisons will return boolean arrays, like their unadorned
  ndarray counterpart. (#29)

* Fix raising a unitless `UnitArray` raised to a power. Thanks to @rupertnash
  for reporting and fixing the bug. (#5)

* Remove trivial (0.0) offsets from the string representation of units. (#27)

* Enhance the unit parser to parse all of the provided units, with or without
  offsets. (#25)

* Correct the definition of PPG to be a density unit instead of a pressure
  gradient unit. Calculations using PPG as a pressure gradient unit can be
  recovered simply by multiplying the PPG quantity by g, the acceleration due
  to gravity. To precisely recover the exact values from the previous
  definition, use ``0.0519 * psi_per_f / ppg`` for this value, which is not
  necessarily the best estimate for g.
