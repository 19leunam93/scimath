SciMath CHANGELOG
=================

Change summary since 4.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* UnitArray comparisons will return boolean arrays, like their unadorned
  ndarray counterpart. (#29)
* Correct the definition of PPG to be a density unit instead of a pressure
  gradient unit. Calculations using PPG as a pressure gradient unit can be
  recovered simply by multiplying the PPG quantity by g, the acceleration due
  to gravity. To precisely recover the exact values from the previous
  definition, use ``0.0519 * psi_per_f / ppg`` for this value, which is not
  necessarily the best estimate for g.
